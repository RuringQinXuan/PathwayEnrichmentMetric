My Project

This project is designed for pathway enrichment.

Background Information:
Pathway enrichment is a process that a set of genes is enriched to a pathway.
One pathway is a set of genes for a specific biological activity, such as disease.

So if we want to do pathway enrichment, we need a gene set and a list of pathways.

The gene set come from a list of drug-related PubMed abstract files by text mining method.
Thus we have drug-gene relation.
The pathway list comes from KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes: https://www.kegg.jp/).
After pathway enrichment, we get gene-pathway relation.
The pathway-disease relation is obvious.
Thus, we get drug-gene-pathway-disease relation through this pipline.

What we want to do is to compare the 4 text mining methods and 7 new pathway enrichment methods among 16 drugs.
The drugs are known drug repositioning drugs.
(Drug information is in the drug_information file.)
To valid this comparison, the drug-pathway is collected from CTD.
CTD site:http://ctdbase.org/voc.go;jsessionid=D0CF3F567BB6478BDB9E1BA92D92EC69?type=pathway 


So based on the drug information, the drug-related abstracts are retrieval from the PubMed with drug name as keyword.
Thus, we get the drug PubMed data.

indicators=['IPF_gene','IPF_box','IPF_short','IPF_short_gene','IPF_short_box','IPF_gene_box','IPF_gene_box_short','P']
methods=['abstract','sentence','dependency','tees']
drugs_file_dir='./data/drug/drug_name.txt'

The result is all about evaluation.
The evaluation folder:
1,rank_data
The rank_data is about the pathway enrichment result.
The content about one file of rank_data is a dic, with pathway list holding 301 pathways as keys and the pathway rank list as values.
The name of file in rank_data is drug_method_indicator.
2,picture
the data is about the first [1:x] pathway holding the known pathway number in evaluated pathway list.
