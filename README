My Project

This project is designed for pathway enrichment.

Background Information:
Pathway enrichment is a process that a set of genes is enriched to a pathway.
One pathway is a set of genes for a specific biological activity, such as drug and disease.

So if we want to do pathway enrichment, we need a gene set and a list of pathways.
In this project,

The gene set comes from a list of drug-related PubMed abstract files by text mining method.
The pathway list comes from KEGG(Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes: https://www.kegg.jp/).

What we want to do is to compare the 4 text mining methods and 7 new pathway enrichment methods.
To valid this comparison, the drug-pathway is collected from CTD()
